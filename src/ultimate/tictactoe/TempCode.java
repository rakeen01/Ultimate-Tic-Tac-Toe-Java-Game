/* Analysis:

    The following program implements a fully-functioning game of the traditional
    'Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe'. The basic rules are:

        1. The user must indicate their letter of choice, and whether they want to play
           against the computer or another human player at the beginning of each game.

        2.  Each turn, the user marks one of the small squares. So when the user
            gets three in a row on a small board, the user wins that board.

        3.  To win the game, the user needs to win three small boards in a row.

        4.  The user can only place a mark on the board determined by the position of the user's
            opponentâ€™s last placed mark. So, if they put an X or O in the top right corner
            of a square, the user's next move must occur in the top right board.
 
    
    A few specific rules apply to this version of the game:
        
        1.  A move can take place as long as there is an open square on a board. This means
            that the user/computer can force the opponent to choose an open square in an already
            won/tied board.

        2.  If the board is already full, the user gets a free pass to place his/her mark in
            any other board.

/* Design:
    
    The entities involved in the implementation of this game has been divided so that they
    can be represented by each of the classes. The classes are:
    1.  DriverMain: This is the driver program which runs the game
    2.  MySymbol:   This class represents the symbol chosen by each player
    3.  Computer:   This class represents information and functionalities of the computer playing the game.
    4.  Human:      This class represents information and functionalities of the human playing the game.
    5.  SmallBoard: This class represents the smaller tic-tac-toe boards.
    6.  LargeBoard: This class represents the ultimate TTT board.
    7.  MyGame:     Called by DriverMain, this class utilizes the other classes to start the game, run
                    the game, print the output after each game and check for the winner for each board and the
                    overall game.
